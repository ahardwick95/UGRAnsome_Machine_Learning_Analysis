# UGRAnsome_Machine_Learning_Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the UGRansome dataset using three different machine learning models. The project focuses on comparing the performance of these models based on standard evaluation metrics.

## Project Overview

Ransomware is a growing threat in cybersecurity. This project analyzes the UGRansom dataset, a dataset designed for ransomware detection research, and evaluates the performance of three machine learning models:
1. **Model A**: Random Forest
2. **Model B**: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. **Model C**: Gaussian Naïve Bayes

The key steps in this project include:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Checking the dataset for missing values, duplicates, and the types of data in the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzing the dataset to understand the relationship between the features and target value.
- **Model Training**: Training the models on the preprocessed dataset.
- **Metrics Comparison**: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score and then comparing each model’s performance against the others.

## Future Work

To enhance this project and explore more sophisticated machine learning techniques, I plan to:
1. **Experiment with Neural Networks**: Use deep learning models such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) , Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and autoencoders to analyze the UGRansom dataset. 
2. **Compare Advanced Models**: Benchmark the performance of neural networks against the existing models (Random Forest, SVM, GBM) to assess their effectiveness for ransomware detection.
3. **Optimize Hyperparameters**: Perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization for all models.
4. **Incorporate Feature Engineering**: Investigate additional features that may improve model performance.
